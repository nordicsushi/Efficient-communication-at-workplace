### Sample Expressions

#### 1. Brief Greeting
- "Hey everyone, good morning!"
- "Morning all!"
- "Hey team, how's it going?"

#### 2. Share Yesterday's Progress
- "So yesterday I wrapped up the authentication module and got all the unit tests passing. Pretty happy with how that turned out."
- "Yesterday I knocked out those three bugs we had in the backlog - the login issue, the timeout problem, and that weird caching thing."
- "So I spent most of yesterday refactoring the payment service. Got it cleaned up and the code's way more maintainable now."

#### 3. Share Today's Plans
- "Today I'm jumping into the notification service. Planning to get the basic email templates done and maybe start on the push notification logic if I have time."
- "So today I'm gonna focus on code review for the team and then start working on that new dashboard feature we prioritized yesterday."
- "Today's pretty straightforward - I need to finish up the documentation for the API changes and then I'll start the performance optimization work."

#### 4. Describe Blocker (if applicable)
- "I'm actually stuck on something - I need access to the production logs to debug this issue, but I don't have the right permissions. Could someone help me out with that?"
- "Yeah, so I hit a blocker yesterday. The third-party API we're integrating with is returning inconsistent responses and I'm not sure if it's on our end or theirs. Might need to jump on a call with their support."
- "Running into an issue with the CI pipeline - it keeps failing on the deployment step and I can't figure out why. Could use a second pair of eyes on this."

#### 5. Mention Dependencies
- "Just a heads up - I'll need those API specs from Jordan before I can finish the integration work."
- "I'm depending on Lisa's PR being merged before I can start testing my changes, so hopefully that goes through today."
- "Once Marcus finishes the authentication updates, I'll be able to hook up the user permissions on my end."
