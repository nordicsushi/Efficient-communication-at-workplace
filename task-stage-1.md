## Task
Here are the requirements for completing this task: 
- Your goal is to create one Mermaid diagram demonstrating the speaking flow for each type of meeting that I can apply.  
- You don't need to specify the exact words I should say, but rather provide a workflow format that I can use every time I speak, which also clearly conveys what I need to express to others.  
- You should create the mind flow based on the meeting type and the speaker's role (presenter, attendee, facilitator, one-on-one, etc.) 
- The mind flow you create should be as natural as how a person who is excellent at communication and speaking would handle it. 
- The context is a tech company, so adapt the workflow to this scenario.
