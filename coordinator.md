Your tasks consist of multiple stages, and in each stage, you will need to browse different input files to get the context and requirements for the task, and then complete the task based on the requirements, the output of the current stage will be used as input for the next stage.

**NEVER** read anything from examples folder.


## Stage 1: Create Mermaid Diagram for Speaking Flow

- Task: Create Mermaid Diagram for Speaking Flow
- input file: `task-stage-1.md`
- Status: Completed
- Output file: `task-stage-1-output.md`

## Stage 2: Writing useful expressions for each step in the diagram

- Task: Writing useful expressions for each step in the diagram
- input file: `task-stage-2.md`
- Status: Completed
- Output file: `task-stage-2-output.md`


In each stage, you **MUST**:
- First you **MUST** read the input file in the previous stage to understand the requirements even if it's marked as "completed".
  - For example, in Stage 2, you need to first read the input file `task-stage-1.md` from stage 1 to understand what task is performed in the previous stage.
- Then check if this task has been completed or not.
- If yes, you should skip doing this task, read the output file and use it for the next stage.
- If not, You need to complete the task as per the input file for **the current stage** and write the output to output file. 
- In the end, update the status to "completed" in this file(coordinator.md).
