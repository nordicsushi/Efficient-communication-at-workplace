## Case 1: Daily Stand-up Meeting (Attendee)

### B1: Greet the team briefly

1. "Hey everyone, good morning!"
2. "Morning team!"
3. "Hey folks!"
4. "Hi all!"
5. "Good morning everyone, hope you're all doing well."

### B2: Share yesterday's accomplishments

1. "So yesterday I wrapped up the feature extraction pipeline for the recommendation model, got it deployed to staging and it's looking pretty good."
2. "Yesterday was mostly focused on debugging that data drift issue we talked about on Monday. Turned out it was a timezone conversion problem, but I got it fixed and the model's back to normal accuracy."
3. "I spent most of yesterday on the A/B test analysis for the new ranking algorithm. The results are actually really promising – we're seeing about a 3% lift in engagement."
4. "Yesterday I finished up the code review feedback from last week and merged the PR for the model monitoring dashboard. Also started looking into that feature request from the product team."
5. "So I got through the model retraining pipeline yesterday, and the new version is performing better on the validation set. Also had a sync with the data eng team about the new data source."

### B3: Outline today's planned work

1. "Today I'm planning to focus on optimizing the inference latency – we're still seeing some slowness at peak hours, so I want to profile the model and see where the bottleneck is."
2. "For today, I'll be working on integrating the new features into the production model and hopefully getting that deployed by end of day."
3. "Today's pretty much dedicated to documentation. I know we've been behind on that, so I'm going to document the model architecture and the deployment process."
4. "I'm going to start experimenting with that new transformer architecture we discussed last week. Want to see if we can get better results without too much computational overhead."
5. "So today, plan is to wrap up the unit tests for the data preprocessing module and then start on the model versioning implementation."

### B4: Mention any blockers or dependencies

1. "One thing I'm blocked on – I need access to the prod database to validate those metrics. Can someone help me with the permissions?"
2. "No blockers for now, but I'll probably need a review on that PR by tomorrow if we want to hit our sprint deadline."
3. "Just a heads up, I'm waiting on the new training data from the data pipeline team. They said it should be ready by noon, but if it's delayed, I might shift to other tasks."
4. "I do have one dependency – I need Sarah's feature engineering work to be merged before I can start on my task, but I think she mentioned it'll be done today."
5. "No major blockers, though it'd be great to sync with Alex later about the API changes. I want to make sure my integration approach aligns with what he's doing."

### C3: Ask clarifying questions or offer help

1. "Hey John, you mentioned that latency issue – is that happening in staging or prod? I ran into something similar last month, happy to share what worked for me."
2. "Quick question about the data schema changes you mentioned – will that affect the training pipeline too, or just inference?"
3. "I can help with that testing if you need another pair of eyes. I have some bandwidth this afternoon."
4. "That sounds like the same error I debugged last week. Want me to send you the fix I used?"
5. "For the model deployment thing you mentioned, are you using the new CI/CD pipeline or the old one? I can help walk through it if you need."

## Case 2: Weekly Stand-up Meeting (Attendee)

### B1: Greet the team

1. "Hey everyone, good to see you all!"
2. "Morning team, hope everyone had a good week!"
3. "Hi folks, thanks for joining!"
4. "Hey all, good morning!"
5. "Good morning everyone!"

### B2: Summarize last week's key achievements

1. "So last week was pretty productive. I got the entire recommendation model pipeline refactored, which should make it way easier for us to experiment with different algorithms. Also shipped that feature that product's been asking for."
2. "Last week I wrapped up the model performance investigation that we started two weeks ago. Found the root cause and implemented a fix that improved accuracy by about 5%. Also onboarded the new intern and got them set up with their first task."
3. "Big thing last week was getting the A/B test set up and running for the new ranking model. We're collecting data now and should have initial results by Wednesday. I also migrated three legacy models to the new serving infrastructure."
4. "Last week I focused on the data quality issues we've been seeing. Built out some monitoring dashboards and automated alerts, so we should catch these problems earlier now. Also did a knowledge sharing session on ML model debugging."
5. "So last week, shipped the v2 of our fraud detection model to production, which is now handling 100% of the traffic. The metrics look solid so far. I also cleared out most of my code review backlog."

### B3: Highlight significant ML metrics or model improvements

1. "The cool thing is we're seeing the validation loss drop to 0.32, which is the lowest we've had on this model. Precision also went up from 87% to 91%."
2. "Just to call out some numbers – the inference latency is now down to 45 milliseconds from 120, which is huge for the user experience."
3. "On the metrics front, we hit our OKR target for model accuracy. We're now at 94.5% on the test set, and engagement is up 8% since we deployed."
4. "The model's performing really well in production. We're seeing 15% fewer false positives compared to the old version, which the ops team is pretty happy about."
5. "One metric worth mentioning – the new feature embeddings improved our ranking model's NDCG by 0.12, which is actually a pretty significant lift for this use case."

### B4: Outline this week's priorities and goals

1. "This week, main priority is getting the ensemble model implemented and tested. If that goes well, I'd like to start the rollout process by Thursday."
2. "For this week, I'm going to focus on the model explainability work. The compliance team needs documentation on how our model makes decisions, so that's top of my list."
3. "This week is all about optimization. I want to reduce the model size by at least 30% without sacrificing accuracy, so we can deploy it to edge devices."
4. "My main goals this week are to finish the hyperparameter tuning experiments and finalize the model architecture for Q4. Also want to start exploring that new dataset we got access to."
5. "So this week, priority number one is fixing the production issues that came up over the weekend. After that, I'll get back to the feature development work for the next sprint."

### B5: Discuss any blockers or resource needs

1. "One thing I want to flag – I'm going to need more GPU quota for the training experiments. The current allocation is maxed out and I'm seeing some jobs getting queued for hours."
2. "No major blockers right now, but I could use some feedback from the product team on the model requirements. There's some ambiguity around the acceptance criteria."
3. "Just a heads up, I'm blocked on the security review for the new data pipeline. I submitted it last week but haven't heard back yet. If that drags on, it might impact our timeline."
4. "I'll need to schedule time with a couple of you for architecture reviews. Probably an hour or so each, sometime this week if possible."
5. "No blockers currently, but I'm keeping an eye on the infrastructure migration happening Wednesday. If anything breaks, my tasks might get delayed."

### C3: Propose collaboration or offer assistance

1. "Hey Maria, for that data preprocessing issue you mentioned – I actually built something similar last quarter. Want me to share the code? Might save you some time."
2. "I'd be happy to pair with you on that integration testing. We could knock it out together this afternoon if you're free."
3. "Sounds like we're working on related problems. Maybe we should sync up and see if we can share some of the infrastructure work?"
4. "If you need help with the model evaluation, I can jump in. I've been meaning to learn more about that part of the system anyway."
5. "I have some cycles freed up from the thing that got deprioritized. Let me know if you need an extra hand with any of your tasks."

## Case 3: Knowledge Sharing Meeting (Facilitator)

### B1: Open the meeting with greeting

1. "Alright, hey everyone! Thanks so much for joining today's knowledge share. Good to see so many folks here!"
2. "Good morning everyone! Welcome to this week's tech talk. Really excited about today's session."
3. "Hey all, thanks for making the time to be here! Let's go ahead and get started."
4. "Welcome everyone! Great to have you all here for today's knowledge sharing session."
5. "Hi everyone, good morning! Glad to see everyone could make it. Let's dive in!"

### B2: Provide context for the session

1. "So just to set the stage, we've been running these knowledge shares every week as a way for folks to learn from each other and share interesting stuff they've been working on or learning about."
2. "For those who are new to these sessions, this is a pretty informal setting where we get together to hear about cool technical topics, new tools, or lessons learned from recent projects."
3. "Today's session is part of our ongoing series on ML infrastructure. We've covered a few different topics over the past weeks, and today's talk fits really nicely into that theme."
4. "Before we jump in, just want to mention that this is an open forum – feel free to ask questions during the presentation or save them for the end, whatever works better."
5. "Quick context – we started these knowledge shares because there's so much interesting work happening across different teams, and it's a great way for us to stay connected and learn from each other."

### B3: Introduce the presenter with background

1. "Today we have Sarah Chen presenting. For those who don't know Sarah, she's been with the ML platform team for about three years, working on our model serving infrastructure. She's basically the go-to person when things break in production."
2. "So our presenter today is Alex. Alex joined us about a year ago from the research team and has been doing some really innovative work on transformer architectures. Really excited to hear what he's been working on."
3. "We're lucky to have Jamie presenting today. Jamie's been leading the data quality initiative for the past six months and has some really valuable insights to share from that experience."
4. "Our speaker today is Mike Rodriguez, who many of you probably know from the model training team. Mike's been experimenting with some interesting approaches to hyperparameter optimization that have shown some pretty impressive results."
5. "I'm really excited to introduce today's presenter, Emily. Emily's one of our senior ML engineers who's been doing some fascinating work on model explainability, which is becoming super important for us."

### B4: Introduce the topic and its relevance

1. "Sarah's going to talk about how we reduced model inference latency by 70%, which is pretty incredible. This is super relevant because I know a lot of teams have been running into performance issues, so hopefully there'll be some lessons you can apply to your own work."
2. "Today's topic is about building robust feature pipelines. This is something that pretty much everyone here deals with in some capacity, so I think you'll find it really practical and immediately useful."
3. "The topic today is going to be on A/B testing for ML models, specifically some of the pitfalls and best practices. Given that most of our teams are running experiments regularly, this should be pretty valuable."
4. "Mike's going to walk us through his approach to automated hyperparameter tuning at scale. This is something that could save us a ton of time and compute resources across the org."
5. "Today's presentation is on model interpretability techniques, which is becoming increasingly important as we deploy more models in customer-facing products. The compliance and product teams have been asking for this kind of insight, so this is really timely."

### B5: Set expectations for Q&A format

1. "Feel free to jump in with questions as we go, or if you prefer, we can save them for the end. Sarah, whatever works better for you."
2. "We'll have time for Q&A after the presentation, but if something's unclear while Sarah's presenting, don't hesitate to speak up."
3. "Just so everyone knows, we have about 30 minutes for the presentation and then we'll open it up for questions and discussion for the last 15 minutes."
4. "If you have questions during the talk, drop them in the chat and we'll address them either during or at the end, depending on how we're doing on time."
5. "Let's do Q&A at the end so Sarah can get through the material, but if there's something that's blocking your understanding, definitely ask."

### D2: Facilitate Q&A session

1. "Alright, let's open it up for questions. Who wants to go first? Don't be shy!"
2. "That was awesome, thanks Sarah. Let's take some questions. I saw a few in the chat – John, you want to kick us off?"
3. "Great stuff. So who has questions? I have a couple myself but let me see if others want to go first."
4. "Okay, Q&A time. And while folks are thinking, I'll start – I'm curious about how this approach handles edge cases?"
5. "Let's hear your questions. And if you're feeling shy, I collected a few from the chat that I can read out."

### E1: Summarize key takeaways

1. "Okay, so just to recap the main points – we learned about the three-stage optimization approach, the importance of caching intermediate results, and that monitoring setup that can catch issues before they become problems. Really valuable stuff."
2. "So the big takeaways here are: one, feature engineering matters more than we think; two, data validation should be automated; and three, there's this framework Sarah mentioned that we can all start using. Good stuff to keep in mind."
3. "Just to tie this together – the key insight is that investing time upfront in proper experiment design saves a ton of headaches later. And those statistical gotchas Sarah mentioned are definitely things to watch out for."
4. "The main themes I'm taking away: start simple, measure everything, and iterate based on data rather than intuition. Classic ML advice but really well demonstrated here."
5. "So in summary, we saw how systematic hyperparameter tuning can lead to significant performance gains, and more importantly, how to actually implement this without blowing through our compute budget."

### E2: Thank the presenter

1. "Sarah, this was fantastic. Thanks so much for putting this together and sharing your experience with us. This is super helpful."
2. "Really appreciate you taking the time to prepare this, Alex. I know I learned a lot and I'm sure everyone else did too."
3. "Thanks Jamie, this was exactly the kind of practical insight we need. Really valuable."
4. "Mike, this was awesome. Thanks for sharing all those details and being so open about what worked and what didn't. That's really helpful."
5. "Emily, thank you so much. This was really well done and I think it's going to influence how a lot of us approach our work."

### E3: Provide closing remarks

1. "Alright everyone, thanks for joining and for all the great questions. These sessions are always better when folks engage, so I appreciate it."
2. "That wraps up today's session. The slides will be shared in the channel, and Sarah mentioned she's happy to follow up if anyone has more questions."
3. "Thanks everyone for being here. Don't forget to fill out the quick feedback form I'll drop in the chat – it helps us make these sessions better."
4. "Great discussion today. If anyone wants to continue the conversation, feel free to ping Sarah directly or keep the discussion going in our channel."
5. "Appreciate everyone making the time for this. These knowledge shares only work because folks like Sarah are willing to share, and people like you show up and engage."

### E4: Announce next session details if applicable

1. "Quick reminder – next week we have Jamie talking about data pipeline optimization. Should be good. Same time, same place."
2. "Before we go, heads up that next week's session is on neural architecture search. Calendar invite should be going out later today."
3. "And just so everyone knows, we're taking a break next week for the team offsite, but we'll be back the week after with a presentation on model monitoring."
4. "Next week's topic is going to be on distributed training at scale. Looking forward to that one."
5. "We don't have next week's topic confirmed yet, but keep an eye on the channel. We should have an announcement by Wednesday."

## Case 4: Technical Meeting / Code Review (Presenter/Communicator)

### B1: Greet attendees and thank them for joining

1. "Hey everyone, thanks so much for making the time. I know everyone's busy, so I really appreciate you all being here."
2. "Hi all, thanks for jumping on. This shouldn't take too long, but I wanted to get your input on something."
3. "Good morning everyone, thanks for joining. Really appreciate you carving out time for this."
4. "Hey folks, thank you for being here. I know this was kind of short notice, so thanks for being flexible."
5. "Hi everyone, thanks for joining the call. Great to have you all here."

### B2: State the purpose and agenda of the meeting

1. "So the reason I wanted to get everyone together is to talk through a technical issue I ran into with the model serving layer, and I want to get your feedback on the approach I'm thinking of taking. Should take about 30 minutes – I'll walk through the context, show you what I'm proposing, and then we can discuss."
2. "What I want to cover today is a code review for the new feature pipeline I've been working on. There are a few architectural decisions I want to run by you all before I merge this. Probably need about 20-25 minutes."
3. "The agenda for today is pretty straightforward – I found a pretty critical bug in our data preprocessing logic, and I want to walk through what happened, what I think we should do about it, and get your thoughts. Should be quick, maybe 20 minutes total."
4. "So I called this meeting because I need some input on the model optimization approach for the recommendation system. I've done some experiments and want to share the results and discuss next steps. Plan is 15 minutes for me to present, and then let's discuss."
5. "Today I want to go over the new monitoring infrastructure I've been setting up. There are some decisions I want to get team alignment on before I move forward. I'll walk through the architecture, and then we can talk through the trade-offs."

### B3: Provide background context of the technical issue

1. "So just to give everyone the background – we've been seeing intermittent failures in the model serving endpoint over the past two weeks. It's not super frequent, but it's happening enough that users are noticing. I dug into the logs and traced it back to how we're handling concurrent requests."
2. "Quick context here – as part of the Q3 roadmap, we're trying to reduce inference latency by 50%. The current system is pretty straightforward but not optimized. We're basically doing sequential processing where we could be parallelizing."
3. "Let me set the stage. We onboarded this new data source last month, which is great because it gives us way more training data. But the schema is a bit different from what we're used to, and it's causing some issues downstream in the feature engineering pipeline."
4. "So here's what's going on. We have this legacy model that's still running in production, and it's using a really old version of TensorFlow. We need to migrate it to the new infrastructure, but it's not a straightforward port because some of the APIs have changed."
5. "Background is that we've been getting complaints from the product team about model performance – specifically, they're seeing lower accuracy for certain user segments. I did some investigation and found that the issue is actually in how we're splitting the training data."

### B4: Explain why this issue matters to the team/project

1. "This matters because if we don't fix this, we're going to keep seeing these failures, and eventually it'll escalate to a P0. Plus, it's affecting user experience, which impacts our team's reliability metrics."
2. "The reason this is important is that latency is one of our key KPIs for this quarter, and we're not going to hit our goals with the current setup. Also, faster inference means we can serve more requests with the same infrastructure, which saves on costs."
3. "This is pretty critical because the data quality issues are affecting our model accuracy. We're seeing a 10% drop in performance on the validation set, which means we can't really trust the models we're training right now."
4. "Why this matters – this legacy model is actually handling about 30% of our production traffic. If it breaks during the migration, that's a significant user impact. Plus, we're blocking on this to deploy some new features that the product team wants."
5. "This accuracy issue is important because it's affecting our core product metrics. The product team is seeing conversion rates drop for specific cohorts, and they've traced it back to our model predictions. So we need to fix this pretty urgently."

### C1: Present the technical problem in detail

1. "So let me show you what's actually happening. When we get multiple requests hitting the endpoint at the same time, there's a race condition in how we're loading the model weights. I can share my screen and walk you through the code."
2. "The issue is in the feature extraction layer. Right now we're using this approach where we compute features on-the-fly, but that's adding about 200 milliseconds to every request. Let me pull up the profiler results so you can see where the time is going."
3. "Here's the specific problem – the new data source has nested JSON structures, but our current parser expects flat dictionaries. When it encounters the nested structure, it's either dropping fields or mis-parsing them. I've got some examples here I can show you."
4. "Let me walk through the migration challenge. The old model uses tf.contrib, which doesn't exist anymore in TF 2.0. We need to replace it with the new equivalents, but some of the functions don't have direct replacements. Here's the specific code that's problematic."
5. "The root cause is in our data splitting logic. We're doing a simple random split, but we're not stratifying by user segment. So some segments are underrepresented in the training set, which is why those predictions are worse. Let me show you the data distribution."

### C2: Walk through code or system architecture

1. "Okay, so if you look at this code right here, you can see we're initializing the model inside the request handler. That's the issue – we should be doing this once at startup, not on every request. Then down here, you can see where the race condition happens when multiple threads try to access this."
2. "Let me walk you through the architecture. Here's the current flow – request comes in, we extract features, load the model, run inference, and return results. The bottleneck is this feature extraction step. Now let me show you what I'm proposing..."
3. "So this is our parsing function. You can see it's using json.loads and then accessing fields directly with bracket notation. When those fields don't exist or are nested, this raises a KeyError and we catch it but just log and skip it. That's where we're losing data."
4. "Here's the current model code using the old TF APIs. And this over here is what it would look like with the new APIs. The tricky part is this section here, where we're using a custom layer that doesn't have a direct equivalent."
5. "If we look at the data splitting code, you can see we're just doing train_test_split with random_state set. But look at these histograms – the distribution of user segments is really skewed between train and test. That's the problem."

### C3: Propose solution approach and alternatives

1. "So here's what I'm thinking. Approach one is to move the model initialization to startup and use a singleton pattern, which should fix the race condition. That's probably the quickest fix. Approach two would be to completely refactor this to use a proper model server like TorchServe or TF Serving, which would be more robust but takes longer to implement."
2. "I see three possible solutions. One, we could pre-compute all the features and cache them, which would make inference super fast but uses a lot of memory. Two, we could optimize the feature computation code itself – I think there's room for improvement there. Or three, we could batch the requests and compute features in parallel, which is a middle ground."
3. "Couple of options here. We could write a custom parser that handles nested JSON, which gives us full control but is more code to maintain. Or we could use a library like jsonschema to validate and flatten the data, which is more robust but adds a dependency. Or we could ask the data team to flatten it on their end before sending it to us."
4. "For the migration, I see two paths. One is to rewrite the custom layer using the new TF APIs, which is doable but takes time and we need to make sure the behavior is identical. The other option is to actually just keep using TF 1.x for this specific model in compatibility mode, which is less ideal long-term but gets us unblocked faster."
5. "I think we should implement stratified splitting where we ensure each segment is proportionally represented in train and test sets. Alternative would be to use a different splitting strategy like time-based splits, but I don't think that makes sense for our use case."

### C4: Explain trade-offs and your recommendation

1. "So here's how I see the trade-offs. The singleton approach is quick and relatively low-risk – probably can do it in a day or two. The model server approach is definitely more robust and scalable, but it's probably a two-week project and has some infrastructure dependencies. My recommendation is we do the quick fix now to stop the bleeding, and then plan the proper refactor for next quarter."
2. "Trade-offs: pre-computing is fastest but memory-intensive, which might be an issue given our current resource constraints. Optimizing the code is medium effort and gives us decent gains. Batching is the most complex but probably gives us the best balance of speed and resource usage. I'm leaning towards batching because I think it's the most sustainable long-term solution."
3. "The custom parser gives us flexibility but it's more code to maintain and test. The library approach is cleaner and more maintainable, plus it handles edge cases we might not think of. The data team option would be ideal but they're pretty backed up. I'd recommend we go with jsonschema – it's battle-tested and the dependency is worth it for the robustness we get."
4. "Rewriting the layer is the 'right' way to do it, but honestly it's risky because we need to validate that the behavior is exactly the same, and that's hard to test comprehensively. The compatibility mode is a bit hacky, but it's low-risk and buys us time. My take is we should go with compatibility mode for now, and put the proper rewrite on the backlog for Q4."
5. "Stratified splitting is the standard approach for this kind of problem, and it's not very complex to implement – maybe half a day of work. The main trade-off is that our historical test sets used random splitting, so comparisons might be a bit tricky. But I think that's worth it for the improved model performance. I'd say let's go with stratified splitting."

### D1: Open floor for questions and feedback

1. "So that's what I'm thinking. What are your thoughts? Any concerns or suggestions?"
2. "Alright, that's my proposal. I'd love to hear your feedback, especially if you see any issues I might have missed."
3. "That's the overview. Let me pause here – what questions do you have?"
4. "Okay, so that's the plan. Does this make sense? Any thoughts or concerns?"
5. "So that's where I'm at. I wanted to get your input before I move forward with this. What do you think?"

### D3: Address concerns and discuss alternatives

1. "That's a great point about the memory usage. Yeah, we'd need to monitor that closely. Maybe we could implement some kind of LRU cache with a size limit so we don't run out of memory? What do you think?"
2. "Good catch on the backward compatibility issue. I hadn't fully thought through how this affects the existing clients. Maybe we need to version the API and support both for a transition period?"
3. "You're right that testing this thoroughly is going to be tricky. What if we set up a shadow deployment where we run both versions in parallel and compare the outputs? That way we can validate it works before fully switching over."
4. "Yeah, I hear your concern about the added complexity. Maybe there's a simpler approach – what if we just do the most critical optimization first and see if that gets us enough improvement before we go full batching?"
5. "That's fair, the timeline might be too aggressive. If we push it out a week and maybe get another person helping with the testing, does that feel more realistic?"

### E1: Summarize agreement or key points

1. "Okay, so sounds like we're aligned on going with the singleton pattern as the immediate fix, and we'll plan the model server refactor for next quarter. I'll put together a quick design doc for that."
2. "Alright, so we're going with the batching approach, but we'll start with just the preprocessing step and see if that's enough before optimizing further. And we'll keep an eye on the resource metrics to make sure we're not causing issues."
3. "Got it. So we'll use jsonschema for the parsing, and I'll add comprehensive tests to make sure we're handling all the edge cases. And we'll document the schema so future changes are easier to handle."
4. "Okay, consensus is to use TF compatibility mode for now, with the understanding that we'll need to properly migrate by Q4. I'll make sure to document that this is temporary and why we made this choice."
5. "Cool, so stratified splitting it is. I'll update the data pipeline code, retrain the models, and we'll do a comparison to validate that the test metrics are actually improving."

### E2: Outline next steps and action items

1. "So next steps: I'll implement the singleton fix by Wednesday, deploy it to staging for testing, and if that looks good, we'll push to prod on Friday. I'll also draft the design doc for the model server refactor and share it by end of week."
2. "Action items: I'll start on the batching implementation tomorrow, should have a prototype ready by Thursday. Sarah, can you help with the resource monitoring setup? And Mike, could you review the code once I have the PR up?"
3. "Here's what I'm going to do: implement the jsonschema validation by Tuesday, write the tests, and get the PR up for review. I'll also reach out to the data team to give them a heads up about the schema requirements going forward."
4. "Next steps for me: set up the TF compatibility mode, test it locally, and then deploy to a canary environment. I'll also create a ticket for the Q4 migration work so we don't forget about it. Should have the canary deployment done by Wednesday."
5. "Alright, so I'll update the data splitting code, kick off a retraining job – that'll probably take a couple days – and then we'll evaluate the new models. I'll share the results by Friday and we can decide on rollout from there."

### E3: Assign ownership and deadlines

1. "Just to confirm ownership: I'm taking the implementation and deployment. Sarah, you said you can handle the monitoring setup by Thursday, right? And Mike, review by end of week works for you?"
2. "So I'm owning the batching implementation, target is to have it in staging by Thursday. Sarah, you're going to set up the resource monitoring – can you have that ready by Wednesday so I can test with it? And Mike will do the code review once the PR is up."
3. "I'll own the jsonschema work, timeline is Tuesday for the PR. I'll need a review from someone familiar with the data pipeline – Alex, can you do that? Should just need an hour or so."
